Terraform Azure Hub-Spoke Network Infrastructure
This project implements Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to deploy a robust Azure Hub-Spoke network topology. It is designed with scalability, security, and maintainability in mind â€” ideal for enterprise-grade cloud environments.

The solution follows CI/CD best practices, enabling automated, consistent, and repeatable provisioning and updates of the infrastructure using tools like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.

Key Features
Hub Virtual Network: Includes Azure Firewall, VPN Gateway, and custom DNS server

Spoke Virtual Networks: Segregated networks for workloads (e.g., web apps, VMs)

Security: Centralized traffic filtering using Azure Firewall with application rules

Private DNS Zones: Linked to VNets for internal name resolution

User-Defined Routes (UDRs): Control traffic flow via firewall and gateway

Terraform Best Practices: Modular design, variable definitions, and remote state support

CI/CD Integration Ready: Easily connect with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.

Deployment Overview
Write Terraform configuration files to define your infrastructure

Run terraform init to initialize the working directory
